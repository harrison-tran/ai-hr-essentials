# AI and ML Engineering For Dummies - HR and People Guide

To leverage AI to transform HR and people strategy, a functional understanding of the underlying technology is no longer optional. As someone in this field, this literacy is not about learning to code but about developing the capacity to evaluate vendor claims, understand the tools' capabilities and limitations, and communicate effectively with technical candidates and stakeholders. Here we'll demystifies the core technologies driving the HR revolution, cutting through marketing jargon to provide a clear, functional understanding of what AI and Machine Learning are and how they operate within the an organizational management context.

### ðŸ’  **AI/ML Engineering** ðŸ’ 
You hear the terms Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) all the time, and they're often used interchangeably. But in reality, they aren't the same. Understanding the fundamental difference is crucial and the difference is more simple than you think.

Think of it like this - AI is the broad field of creating intelligent machines, while ML is a specific tool or method used to achieve AI.

In this section, we will deconstruct the core concepts of artificial intelligence, differentiating between AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI

<details>
<summary>Artificial Intelligence</summary>
<br>
AI is best understood as a broad, umbrella field of computer science focused on creating machines that can simulate human cognitive functions like learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. It is the overarching concept that encompasses all other technologies discussed here.<br/>
<br>
<li>Real world Example: Voice-assistants like Siri and Alexa, GPS and navigation apps like Google Maps, and even robot vacuums that can navigate the room and avoid obstacles.</li>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Machine Learning</summary>
<br>
ML is a critical subset of AI that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. Instead of following a fixed set of rules, ML algorithms identify patterns in historical data to make predictions or decisions about new, unseen data. The key differentiator from AI is its capacity to improve its performance over time as it is exposed to more data. Even in ML, you will often hear two types, <code>traditional machine learning</code> and <code>deep learning</code>. We will cover deep learning in a seperate drop down but the biggest difference comes down to <code>feature selection</code> , a fancy term for telling the computer what important clues to look for in the data.<br/>
<br>
<code>Dummified version:</code> <i>Traditional ML</i> is like a bright apprentice. You need to guide it and teach it what to look for. It's smart and can learn patterns, but it relies on your expertise to point it in the right direction first. You have to do the heavy lifting of preparing the data and telling the model, "These are the important features you should pay attention to." This process is called <code>feature engineering.</code><br/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Deep Learning & Neural Networks</summary>
<br>
<code>Deep Learning</code> is an advanced subfield of ML that utilizes <i>artificial neural networks</i> or <i>ANNs</i> for short, which are complex, multi-layered algorithms inspired by the structure of the human brain. A basic neural network consists of an input layer (where data enters), one or more hidden layers (where processing occurs), and an output layer (where the result is produced).<br/>
<br>
<code>Dummified version:</code> <i>Deep Learning</i> is like a master artisan who has spent a lifetime honing their craft. You don't need to give it a checklist. You simply show it the raw material and the desired outcome, and through immense experience, it figures out the important features for itself.
<br></br>
<b>Difference between Traditional ML and DL</b>
<br></br>
  
| Feature       | Classical ML | Deep Learning  |
| ------------- |----------------| -------------|
| Human Input      | Requires humans to identify and select important features   | Figures out the important features on its own |
| Data Needs      | Can work with smaller amounts of data        | Needs very large amounts of data to learn effectively |
| Complexity | Simiplier models       | High complex models with many layers (hence the term deep)|
| Best for | Simplier tasks like predicting house prices or filtering spam emails     | Complex tasks like facial recognition, self-driving cars or natural language translation |

### ðŸ’  **How Do Machines Even Learn?** ðŸ’ 

Understanding the basics of how machines learn is beneficial for everyone because it provides insight into the tools that are increasingly shaping our professional and daily lives. For recruiters, this knowledge can help you understand the depth of the candidate's work and how it might apply to the role you're looking to fill.

There are three main ways machines can learn that we'll be covering in this section.

<details>
<summary>Supervised Learning</summary>
<br>
This is the most common type of ML, where the algorithm learns from data that has been manually labeled.<br/>
<br>
<code>Dummified version:</code> Think of supervised learning as a student with a teacher. The teacher will give you 100s of photos of cats and dogs, each properly labelled correctly. The machine's (in this case, the student's) job is to then learn the features that distinguish cats from dogs (e.g., shape of the ears, whiskers, etc.) so that when it sees a new, unlabeled picture, they can accurately predict whether it's a cat or a dog.
<br></br>
<li>Real world Example: Spam filters (labeled as "spam" or "not spam"), predicting house prices (based on labeled data of past sales)</li>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Unsupervised Learning</summary>
<br>
With unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find hidden patterns or structures on its own, without human guidance.<br/>
<br>
<code>Dummified version:</code> Think of unsupervised learning as the complete opposite to supervised learning, a student learning on their own, without a teacher. It's like giving a child a box of assorted blocks and telling them to organize them. They might group them by color, shape, or size without being told how to do it.
<br></br>
<li>Real world Example: E-commerce sites using customer purchase history to group people into "segments" to better target ads, or banks use this to spot unusual credit card transactions that could signal fraud by identifying activity that doesn't fit a customer's normal spending patterns.</li>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Reinforcement Learning</summary>
<br>
With reinforcement learning, the model learns through trial and error by performing actions and receiving "rewards" or "penalties" based on the outcomes.<br/>
<br>
<code>Dummified version:</code> Reinforcement learning is like training a dog with treats. An model (in this case, the dog) learns to perform a task by interacting with an "environment" and receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones. There's no labeled dataset; the model learns through trial and error, trying to maximize its cumulative reward over time. It's all about making a sequence of decisions to reach a goal.
<br></br>
<li>Real world Example: An AI playing a video game like chess, a self-driving car deciding when to brake or accelerate, or a robotic arm learning to pick up an object by trying different movements until it succeeds.</li>
